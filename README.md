## About
My personal website and blog, developed from scratch using Flask for Python and Bootstrap.

## Directories
..*static: contains CSS styles, images used on pages, and third party scripts
..*templates: contains all html templates, subfolder coding_solutions contains all text for Leetcode solution pages
..*home directory: contains flask backend app.py and the associated db

## Forking the Site
..*change the images in the static folder but do not change the location, unless you change the url_for()'s in /home and /blog html pages as well
..*change names or add paths to the app.py file
..*delete the db and/or make a new one and then connect it to the backend in app.py
..*modify the CV to have your own content (please don't impersonate me)
..*of course, modify the pages with your own content
..*change themes in style.css in static file

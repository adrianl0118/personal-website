    <p class="question">
        Given an array arr of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each node has either 0 or 2 children;</li>
        <li>The values of arr correspond to the values of each leaf in an in-order traversal of the tree.  (Recall that a node 
            is a leaf if and only if it has 0 children.)</li>
        <li>The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree 
            respectively.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="question">
        Among all possible binary trees considered, return the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node.  It is 
        guaranteed this sum fits into a 32-bit integer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Premise: Want the biggest leaves to be connected as close to the root as possible to mitigate propagation of their values 
        through multiplication into subsequent sums above them in the tree. Use a vector to keep track of available connection 
        points (at the beginning, just the leaves) and iteratively connect the points (leaf and leaf, leaf and node, reducing size 
        of vector) until the root is reached. At each iteration, connect the two adjacent connecting points that produce the smallest 
        value to minimize propagation--add the product of the two values and replace them with the value of the greatest leaf.

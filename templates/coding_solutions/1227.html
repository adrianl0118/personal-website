    <p class="question">
        n passengers board an airplane with exactly n seats. The first passenger has lost the 
        ticket and picks a seat randomly. But after that, the rest of passengers will:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Take their own seat if it is still available, </li>
        <li>Pick other seats randomly when they find their seat occupied </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="question">
        What is the probability that the n-th person can get his own seat?
    </p>

    <p>
        There's a 50% chance that any passenger other than the guy who lost his seat will have their seat occupied by that guy.
        i.e. did it happen or didn't it? If the plane only has 1 person, then that person will definitely get their own seat.

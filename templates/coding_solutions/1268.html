    <!-- Problem statement (format with p tags)-->
    <p class="question">
        Given an array of strings products and a string searchWord. We want to design a system that suggests at most three product 
        names from products after each character of searchWord is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with the 
        searchWord. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        Return list of lists of the suggested products after each character of searchWord is typed. 
    </p>
    <div class="line"></div>

    <p>
        Slow-form iteration solution. Could probably be done faster with a Trie.

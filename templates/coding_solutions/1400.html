    <p class="question">
        Given a string s and an integer k. You should construct k non-empty palindrome strings using all the characters in s.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        Return True if you can use all the characters in s to construct k palindrome strings or False otherwise.

    <p>
        Hardest part of this problem is logically arriving at the right set of rules for finding a solution.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>In order for there to be enough letters to form a group of palindromes, s.size() must be greater than or equal to k 
            since at minimum each string must contain one letter ( s.size = k is the case where each of the k strings consists of 
            just one letter).</li>
        <li>For producing a precise number of palindromes with the given set of letters, letters that occur with odd frequencies 
            are limiting because due to asymmetry and the constraint that we can not have left over letters these letters must 
            increase the palindrome count; letters that occur with even frequencies, in contrast, can either be absorbed into 
            any of the existing palindromes (by dividing the group in two parts and sticking one on either side of a word) or 
            used to form their own palindrome if we need to increase the count. Therefore, in order for the set of letters to 
            form exactly k palindromes, the number of characters that occur with an odd frequency must not exceed k.</li>
    </ol>

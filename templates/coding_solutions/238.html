    <!-- Problem statement (format with p tags)-->
    <p class="question">
        Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of 
        all the elements of nums except nums[i].
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        Constraint: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole 
        array) fits in a 32 bit integer.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the 
        purpose of space complexity analysis.)

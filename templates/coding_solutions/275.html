    <!-- Problem statement (format with p tags)-->
    <p class="question">
        Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a 
        function to compute the researcher's h-index.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h 
        citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

    <!-- Problem statement (format with p tags)-->
    <p class="question">
        You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of 
        your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions 
        after a bad version are also bad.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following 
        ones to be bad.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find 
        the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
    </p>

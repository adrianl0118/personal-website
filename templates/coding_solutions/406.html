    <!-- Problem statement (format with p tags)-->
    <p class="question">
        Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), 
        where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater 
        than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.
    </p>

    <p>
        Initially, order people by decreasing order of height and increasing order of "taller or equal height people in front" 
        number:
    </p>
    <p>
        [7,0],[7,1],[6,1],[5,0],[5,2],[4,4]
    </p>
    <p>
        This will be the order of entry into the separate reconstructed queue. Iterating over the people, at any given person 
        during the insert, it will be guaranteed that everyone in the existing queue is at least as tall as them--because this 
        is the case, we can insert people on the basis of their "people who are taller or the same height as me who are in front 
        of me" number alone. As an example, the queue would be reconstructed at each iteration as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        [7,0] <br>
        [7,0],[7,1] <br>
        [7,0],[6,1],[7,1] <br>
        [5,0],[7,0],[6,1],[7,1] <br>
        [5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[7,1] <br>
        [5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]
    </p>

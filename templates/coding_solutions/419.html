    <p class="question">
        Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with 'X's, empty slots are 
        represented with '.'s. You may assume the following rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.</li>
        <li>Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 
            1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.</li>
        <li>At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Problem statement (format with p tags)-->
    <p class="question">
        We are to write the letters of a given string S, from left to right into lines. Each line has maximum width 100 units, and 
        if writing a letter would cause the width of the line to exceed 100 units, it is written on the next line. We are given an 
        array widths, an array where widths[0] is the width of 'a', widths[1] is the width of 'b', ..., and widths[25] is the width 
        of 'z'.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        Now answer two questions: how many lines have at least one character from S, and what is the width used by the last such 
        line? Return your answer as an integer list of length 2.
    </p>

    <p class="question">
        Given an array A of integers, for each integer A[i] we may choose any x with -K &lt;= x &lt;= K, and add x to A[i].
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        After this process, we have some array B.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of B and the minimum value of B.

    <p>
        General idea: Find the max and min of the array then add K to the min and subtract K from the max and take the difference. 
        The addition and subtraction of K must not be an overcorrection of either integer with respect to the average of the min and 
        max (i.e. min + K &lt;= min + (max-min)/2, max - K >= min+(max-min)/2 ) - if that is the case, a smaller correction x 
        within -K &lt; x &lt; K can be used so that the difference of min and max approach zero.

        Memory could possibly be improved by eliminating the midpoint variable at the expense of speed, calculating midpoint each time 
        it is needed.
